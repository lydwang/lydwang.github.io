I am a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in Accounting at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I am currently on the job market.

I am interested in the economics of accounting and other information in the digital economy. In particular, I am interested in how unique features of the digital economy challenge or complement existing theories and evidence regarding strategic decision making, such as in the areas of M&A, executive compensation, and non-financial information.

Prior to my Ph.D. at Stanford, I received an A.B. in Applied Mathematics with a focus in Economics from Harvard College. I was born in California and grew up in Michigan.
